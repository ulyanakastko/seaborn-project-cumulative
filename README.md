In this project, I visualised insights using a dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains information about loans awarded by the non-profit Kiva. 

Using Seaborn, Iâ€™ve explored the average loan amount by country using aggregated bar charts. I also visualised the distribution of loan amounts by project type and gender using box plots and violin plots.
